# PhD-project

This project investigates the dynamics of entanglement in open quantum systems (tipically via the Lindbland equation). As this is, a priori, completely dependent on the system under study, you will find here many files dedicated to different physical scenarios.

As of now, this project is only visible to Arijeet Pal and myself.
